            Kate Chaney is committed to tacking the critical issues facing Australia today. <br>
            She is committed to restoring integrity, professional development and transparency in politics.<br>
            She aims to pursue community based incentives and initiatives which bring ebullient outcomes for local residents.<br>
            She is free to represent the communityâ€™s interests and not the interests of political backers or corporate sponsors.<br>
            She will will pursue a balanced, evidence based scientific approach when it comes to tackling the major issues.

        <ul class="nested">
          This party has made excellent use of scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
          They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
          This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>

      <li>
        <span class="caret">3. Viktor Ko (<a href="https://alp.org.au/" target="_blank">Labor</a>)</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          This party is introducing legislation to cap campaign spending for Independent candidates at $800k and donations at $600k to reduce their influence in Australia.<br>
          Under this legislation, political partical parties campaign will be capped at <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-14/labor-unveils-electoral-reform-plans/104602248" target="_blank">$90 million</a>.<br>
          Due to the fact that Labor was successful at the last election, they will receive an extra $20 million of tax payer funded money because their primary vote is greater than 4%.<br>
          The Liberals approved this bill as they will also receive the $20 million benefit.

          <ul class="nested">
            On the 8th February 2025, Australia has made a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-08/donald-trump-supportive-of-aukus-pete-hegseth-says/104913062">$795 million payment directly to the United States</a> as part of their $368 billion AUKUS deal.<br>
            This brings the total amount of money sent to the United States from Australia at $4.7 Billion since the Liberal government announced the policy.

        <span class="caret">5. Fred Mulholland (<a href="https://www.legalisecannabis.org.au/meet_our_house_of_representative_candidates" target="_blank">Legalise Cannabis</a>)</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          This party wants to stop mandatory vaccination programs. They have well researched policies over Immigration and Small Business and they look pretty good.<br>
          Unfortunately this party does not believe in Climate Change and they believe that Renewable Energy is one of the worst sources of power.<br>
          This party wants to allow prostitutes to sell sex but criminalise the buyers.<br>

        <span class="caret">6. Alexander Ironside (<a href = "https://www.onenation.org.au/candidates">One Nation</a>)</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          This is a far right wing Trump style anti-immigration party.<br>
          They want to remove Australia from the United Nations Refugee Convention and intensify the abuse of refugees in detention centres. <br>
          They want to allow discrimination on the grounds of race and religion in order to support a Trump like ban on certain countries with a high percentage of Muslims.<br>
          Under this party it will be very likely that asylum seekers and refugees will be killed "mysteriously"<br>
          One Nation wants to build more coal fired power stations.<br>
