            Nathan Barton is committed to tacking the critical issues facing Australia today. <br>
            He is committed to restoring integrity, professional development and transparency in politics.<br>
            He aims to pursue community based incentives and initiatives which bring ebullient outcomes for local residents.<br>
            He is free to represent the communityâ€™s interests and not the interests of political backers or corporate sponsors.<br>
            He will will pursue a balanced, evidence based scientific approach when it comes to tackling the major issues.

          This party has made excellent use of scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
          They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
          This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>

        <ul class="nested">
          This party is introducing legislation to cap campaign spending for Independent candidates at $800k and donations at $600k to reduce their influence in Australia.<br>
          Under this legislation, political partical parties campaign will be capped at <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-14/labor-unveils-electoral-reform-plans/104602248" target="_blank">$90 million</a>.<br>
          Due to the fact that Labor was successful at the last election, they will receive an extra $20 million of tax payer funded money because their primary vote is greater than 4%.<br>
          The Liberals approved this bill as they will also receive the $20 million benefit.

        <ul class="nested">
          This party has well researched policies over Immigration and Small Business and they look pretty good.<br>
          Unfortunately this party does not believe in Climate Change and they believe that Renewable Energy is one of the worst sources of power.<br>
          This party wants to allow prostitutes to sell sex but criminalise the buyers.<br>

          On the 8th February 2025, Australia has made a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-08/donald-trump-supportive-of-aukus-pete-hegseth-says/104913062">$795 million payment directly to the United States</a> as part of their $368 billion AUKUS deal.<br>
          This brings the total amount of money sent to the United States from Australia at $4.7 Billion since the Liberal government announced the policy.

        <ul class="nested">
          This is a far right wing Trump style anti-immigration party.<br>
          This party is against multiculturalism therefore they would like to allow discrimination on the grounds of race and religion.<br>
          Under this party it will be very likely that asylum seekers and refugees will be killed "mysteriously"<br>
          They will support policies of Donald Trump such as mandating the use of plastic straws and plastic bags as opposed to environmentally friendly options.<br>
          This party supports an oligarchy of agendas that will promote the interests of billionaires at the expense of ordinary citizens.
