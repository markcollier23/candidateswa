          This party has made excellent use of scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
          They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
          This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>

        <ul class="nested">
          This party is introducing legislation to cap campaign spending for Independent candidates at $800k and donations at $600k to reduce their influence in Australia.<br>
          Under this legislation, political partical parties campaign will be capped at <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-14/labor-unveils-electoral-reform-plans/104602248" target="_blank">$90 million</a>.<br>
          Due to the fact that Labor was successful at the last election, they will receive an extra $20 million of tax payer funded money because their primary vote is greater than 4%.<br>
          The Liberals approved this bill as they will also receive the $20 million benefit.

          This party has well researched policies over Immigration and Small Business and they look pretty good.<br>
          Unfortunately this party does not believe in Climate Change and they believe that Renewable Energy is one of the worst sources of power.<br>
          This party wants to allow prostitutes to sell sex but criminalise the buyers.<br>

          <ul class="nested">
            On the 8th February 2025, Australia has made a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-08/donald-trump-supportive-of-aukus-pete-hegseth-says/104913062">$795 million payment directly to the United States</a> as part of their $368 billion AUKUS deal.<br>
            This brings the total amount of money sent to the United States from Australia at $4.7 Billion since the Liberal government announced the policy.

          This party wants to stop mandatory vaccination programs. They have well researched policies over Immigration and Small Business and they look pretty good.<br>
          Unfortunately this party does not believe in Climate Change and they believe that Renewable Energy is one of the worst sources of power.<br>

        <ul class="nested">
          This is a far right wing Trump style anti-immigration party.<br>
          They want to remove Australia from the United Nations Refugee Convention and intensify the abuse of refugees in detention centres. <br>
          They want to allow discrimination on the grounds of race and religion in order to support a Trump like ban on certain countries with a high percentage of Muslims.<br>
          Under this party it will be very likely that asylum seekers and refugees will be killed "mysteriously"<br>
          One Nation wants to build more coal fired power stations.<br>
