            The Australian Democrats uses a science and evidence-based approach to policy.<br>
            This party not only wants to invest in education, skills and training for local workers but they also want to ensure that manufacturing opportunities accentuated will allow repair industries to flourish.<br>
            They place a strong emphasis on a consumers right to repair products as they are concerned about dodgy tactics by corporations who put the repair industry at risk.<br>
            They believe that for too long the repair industry has been in serious decline causing a significant increase in waste, threat to the environment and threat to people's livelihoods if people are increasing relient on parts which are rarely compatible or available in Australia.<br>
            They are determined to implement policies which benefit local industry and local farmers in Australia.<br>
            They believe that Agriculture is the bedrock for food security and therefore wish to review policies to ensure they meet the needs of farmers whilst also ensurinng the benefit of sustainable and self sufficient food production.<br>
            They are concerned that farmers often face unfair contract terms and pricing lacks transparency. Farm machinery is expensive and highly concentrated which limits choice for farmers. Farmers still do not have the right to repair their own machinery as many of the parts are only available overseas.<br>
            In regards to the budget they advocate for a robust, efficient, and effective economy which avoids intergenerational debt and raises revenue effectively.<br>
            To do this, they are looking into insight from various economists and experts which can help pay up the government debt and ensure the economy can work for the best interests of the people.<br>
