<h1>Candidates for the Legislative Council of Western Australia</h1>
<p>
  Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Western Australia.<br>
  Western Australia is lucky to have a fantastic government currently in place but it does need improvement, diversity and accountability.<br>
  Western Australia needs to have political parties in parliament that are strong and stable and won't use and abuse their power.<br>
  To keep a government strong, they need to know there is potentially other effective people surrounding them that have high expectations and expect the best for WA.<br>
  They do not need people who are ready to undermine or attack positive and effective policies of government.<br>
  Whilst all parties would love to have total control, it is important that there are other political parties and candidates in parliament that will help strengthen and support the governing party with any critical policies to protect the state whilst also keeping them in line or in check for any measure that could abuse their power.<br>
  I have researched every candidate and have provided references to their policies and statements.<br>
  The list of candidates are available below:<br>

      <ul class="nested">
          This party has made excellent use of evidence based scientific research to develop it's policies and here are some of the reasons why I believe they should be placed in this vote ranking:<br>
           - They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
           - They have developed the policies to kick-start manufacturing in Western Australia and to improve the quality and profitability of local farms.<br>
           - They have developed policies to take a preventative approach to tackle the rising cost of Hospitals and Health Care Cover<br>
           - They are aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>
           - They are active, hard working and very efficient in parliament house.<br>
           - They have developed policies to improve the quality of Education that will ensure people can access the necessary skills and qualifications for the workforce.<br>
