<h1>Candidates for the Legislative Council of Western Australia</h1>
<p>
  Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Western Australia.<br>
  Western Australia is lucky to have a fantastic government currently in place but it does need improvement, diversity and accountability.<br>
  Western Australia needs to have political parties in parliament that are strong and stable and won't use and abuse their power.<br>
  To keep a government strong, they need to know there is potentially other effective people surrounding them the ability to deliver and implement successful policies which will help the lives of Western Australian residents.<br>
  They do not need people who are ready to undermine or attack positive and effective policies of government.<br>
  Whilst all parties would love to have total control, it is important that there are other political parties and candidates in parliament that will help strengthen and support the governing party with any critical policies to protect the state whilst also keeping them in line or in check for any measure that could abuse their power.<br>
  I have researched every candidate and have provided references to their policies and statements.<br>
  The list of candidates are available below:<br>

            They are placing a strong emphasis on manufacturing is important due to its central role in economic development and resilience and the hugely beneficial flow-on effects to the Australian economy.<br>
            This party wants to better support Australian made products and services through government purchases and public marketing campaigns.<br>
            They will increase taxes on vacant houses and foreign ownership to ensure housing can be affordable for first time buyers.<br>
