<h1>Candidates for the Legislative Council of Western Australia</h1>
<p>
  Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Western Australia.<br>
  Western Australia is lucky to have a fantastic government currently in place but it does need improvement, diversity and accountability.<br>
  Western Australia needs to have political parties in parliament that are strong and stable and won't use and abuse their power.<br>
  To keep a government strong, they need to know there is potentially other effective people surrounding them that have high expectations and expect the best for WA.<br>
  They do not need people who are ready to undermine or attack positive and effective policies of government.<br>
  Whilst all parties would love to have total control, it is important that there are other political parties and candidates in parliament that will help strengthen and support the governing party with any critical policies to protect the state whilst also keeping them in line or in check for any measure that could abuse their power.<br>
  I have researched every candidate and have provided references to their policies and statements.<br>
  The list of candidates are available below:<br>

        The Western Australia Party believes there is a balance between mining, agriculture and the environment.<br>
        While Western Australia is blessed with large reserves of many types of resources, our resources are not unlimited; they are finite.<br>
        Hence we must be careful to utilise them in such a way that there will be reserves left for future generations, and to protect the environment from long term damage through erosion, pollution and other impacts.
        Energy is going through a worldwide transition, from finite fossil fuel sources to renewable sources. Western Australia has to make this transition in a phased and responsible way, to maintain energy security, jobs and the economy.<br>
        We must promote renewable energy services in Western Australia to provide lower-cost, more reliable and sustainable energy services to West Australian households. <br>
        This should be done over a number of years so to protect our state from blackouts.
