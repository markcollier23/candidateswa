<h1>Candidates for Wanneroo in the 2021 WA State Election</h1>
<p>
  Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Western Australia.<br>
  Western Australia is lucky to have a fantastic government currently in place but it does need improvement, diversity and accountability.<br>
  Western Australia needs to have political parties in parliament that are strong and stable and won't use and abuse their power.<br>
  To keep a government strong, they need to know there is potentially other effective people surrounding them the ability to deliver and implement successful policies which will help the lives of Western Australian residents.<br>
  They do not need people who are ready to undermine or attack positive and effective policies of government.<br>
  Whilst all parties would love to have total control, it is important that there are other political parties and candidates in parliament that will help strengthen and support the governing party with any critical policies to protect the state whilst also keeping them in line or in check for any measure that could abuse their power.<br>
  I have researched every candidate and have provided references to their policies and statements.<br>
  The list of candidates are available below:<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="caret">1: <a href="https://greens.org.au/wa/person/martin-dupont" target="_blank">Martin Dupont</a> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4aVfsO7DrY1eO0sFD3RQ7nQzt43IZdX/" target="_blank">Greens</a>)</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          This party has made excellent use of scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
          They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
          This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="caret">2. Sabine Winton (<a href="https://www.wanneroo.walabor.org.au/" target="_blank">Labor</a>)</span>
      <ul class="nested">
        This political party is heavily funded by Corporations ($1.8 Million) and Unions ($0.6 Million). <br>
        It is very difficult for an individual to not be obsequious to this power and influence especially when this party had allowed criminal charges to be laid on bus drivers who brought nurses to a protest entreating a 5% pay rise.<br>
        This party has a clear plan to support the growth of the state economy and has a strong vision for the future of the state.<br>
        WA Labor has been actively encouraging companies to establish operations in Western Australia and has been providing reasonable incentives to attract new industries that will provide economic benefits to the state.<br>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="caret">3. Hendrik Holtzhausen (<a href="https://australianchristians.org.au/district/wanneroo-henk-holtzhausen/" target="_blank">Australian Christians</a>)</span>

      <ul class="nested">
        This party likes to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clan_(Liberal_Party_of_Australia)" target="_blank">branch stacking.</a><br>
        Under the Liberal party government, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNFd4zzPzg22rSvVghGgCf6KqDpEkq6zYHNKBoMNdes">torture and beatings have been able to continue against detainees in highly brutal ways</a>.<br>
        This party has introduced 2 year jail sentences for <a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22legislation%2Fbillsdgs%2F3816040%22">people who expose information that the government doesn't like</a>.

        5. Kunal Naresh Parbat (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w0eQWWRlbEnq1YFHH13t-p1lmykJk3YI/edit" target="_blank">Legalise Cannabis Western Australia</a>)
      </span>
      <ul class="nested">
          This party has 1 policy: To Legalise Cannabis.<br>
          All other policies are foundational from this policy.<br>
          They believe Cannabis will solve all the worlds problems.<br>
          Pushing Cannabis into factories, vehicles and fuels could potentially have major ramifications and disruptions to our supply chains.<br>
          Truck drivers, shipping deliveries and pilots delivering cargo could be significantly affected if Cannabis is imposed into their lives.<br>
          The death tole on all of these workers due to increased road risks from lethargy can significantly impact the ability for essential goods and services to be delivered to WA grocery stores.<br>
      </ul>

        6. Trevor Ruwoldt (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w0eQWWRlbEnq1YFHH13t-p1lmykJk3YI/edit" target="_blank">SFFPWA</a>)
      </span>
      <ul class="nested">
        This party has a significant interest in defending the rights of firearm owners and enthusiasts in Western Australia.<br>
        This is highly dangerous because these types of policies can increase the possibility of shootings to occur such as the Floreat shooting that happened not too long ago.<br>
        Under this party, people could bring a gun with them and say they are selling the gun so that they can boycott any health related restrictions for their daily activities.<br>
        This party is highly dangerous for the health and well being of Western Australians.<br>
        Risking the lives of Western Australians through legalisation of guns is absolutely irresponsible.<br>
