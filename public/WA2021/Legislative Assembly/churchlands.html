<h1>Candidates for Churchlands in the 2021 WA State Election</h1>
<p>
  Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Western Australia.<br>
  During this turbulant year where the world is facing a severe pandemic, it is important to have a strong, sustainable and accounntable government.<br>
  It is very important to have all voices heard and find ways of making the state better and more effective in handling any challenges that comes our way.<br>
  You need to know who your last preference candidate is going to be as well as your first.<br>
  By not voting for the most dangerous and chaotic candidate last, you are increasing the chance of that chaotic candidate too be voted in.<br>
  Western Australia is lucky to have a fantastic government currently in place but it does need improvement, diversity and accountability.<br>
  Western Australia needs to have political parties in parliament that are strong and stable and won't use and abuse their power.<br>
  To keep a government strong, they need to know there is potentially other effective people surrounding them that have high expectations and expect the best for WA.<br>
  They do not need people who are ready to undermine or attack positive and effective policies of government.<br>
  Whilst all parties would love to have total control, it is important that there are other political parties and candidates in parliament that will help strengthen and support the governing party with any critical policies to protect the state whilst also keeping them in line or in check for any measure that could abuse their power.<br>
  I have researched every candidate and have provided references to their policies and statements.<br>
  This election, your vote WILL NOT be counted if you do not number every single candidate.<br>
  The list of candidates are available below:<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="caret">1: Mark Twiss (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4aVfsO7DrY1eO0sFD3RQ7nQzt43IZdX/" target="_blank">Greens</a>)</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          This party has made excellent use of evidence based scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
          They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
          This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>
          They are active, hard working and very efficient in parliament house.<br>
          They have developed the policies to kick-start manufacturing in Western Australia, to improve the quality and profitability of local farms, to take a preventative approach to tackle the rising cost of Hospitals and Health Care Cover, to improve the quality of Education that will ensure people can access the necessary skills and qualifications for the workforce.<br>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
    <span class="caret">2. Christine Tonkin (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Lu44ROqdZkEQXS6BLJgnWUfLggTwC-p/view" target="_blank">Labor</a>)</span>
    <ul class="nested">
      This party has a detailed a significant plan for Western Australia just like the Greens above. <br> 
      They have made WA safe, strong and secure. They could have well reached the very top of my list if it hadn't been for the following:<br>
      - They named a group of people 'anarchists'. They could have worked and co-operated with groups such as Extinction Rebellion who were trying to help the homeless people of WA.<br>
      - They could have better planned and co-ordinated the relocation of homeless people from the tents in Fremantle to places like fruit farms who need workers.<br>
      - Instead of referring Mark Zuckerberg as a 
      <a href="https://thewest.com.au/technology/facebook/facebook-boss-mark-zuckerberg-likened-to-north-korean-dictator-kim-jong-un-by-wa-premier-mark-mcgowan-ng-b881800109z">North Korean dictator</a>
      where he is using his right as the owner of the facebook platform to regulate usage, they should better support and collaborate with the community to use preferred platforms.<br>
      - They responded negatively straight away to a Renewable Energy plan by Zak Kirkup rather than properly assessing feasibility of the plan.<br>
      Labor will support a strong and competitive advanced manufacturing sector.<br>
      WA Labor will actively encourage companies to establish operations in Western Australia and provide reasonable incentives to attract new industries that will provide economic benefits to the state by producing goods or services for export, replace imports, create jobs and facilitate the transfer of valuable skills.<br>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="caret">3. Sean Lestrange (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kOGcvb5paTKv0p_RkpyoCobQ2gK-LQ6E/edit" target="_blank">Liberal</a>)</span>
      <ul class="nested">
        This party has significantly improved their policies and have taken a new strong stand on Renewable Energy and Manufacturing.<br>
        Zak Kirkup and the Liberals have unveiled a visionary plan to build the biggest jobs, renewable energy and export project in the nation, which will lay the foundation for the next 50 years of Western Australian jobs, economic activity and prosperity.<br>
        It’s a mega-project, building the largest renewable energy project in Australia’s history, with wind, solar and large-scale batteries that will transform Western Australia’s energy system for the next 50-years and give WA fuel security and energy independence.<br>
        They strongly support and back the strong policies provided by Mark McGowan on the coronavirus however they have called for the border to open when it was too early.<br>

        This political party is an anti-vaccination party.<br>
        Vaccination is very important to stop the spread of disease.<br>
        People need to vaccinate not just for the benefit of themselves but for others too.<br>
        This political party would put Australia's health at risk!
