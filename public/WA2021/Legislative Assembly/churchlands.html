<h1>Candidates for Churchlands in the 2021 WA State Election</h1>
<p>
  Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Western Australia.<br>
  During this turbulant year where the world is facing a severe pandemic, it is important to have a strong, sustainable and accounntable government.<br>
  It is very important to have all voices heard and find ways of making the state better and more effective in handling any challenges that comes our way.<br>
  You need to know who your last preference candidate is going to be as well as your first.<br>
  By not voting for the most dangerous and chaotic candidate last, you are increasing the chance of that chaotic candidate too be voted in.<br>
  Western Australia is lucky to have a fantastic government currently in place but it does need improvement, diversity and accountability.<br>
  Western Australia needs to have political parties in parliament that are strong and stable and won't use and abuse their power.<br>
  To keep a government strong, they need to know there is potentially other effective people surrounding them that have high expectations and expect the best for WA.<br>
  They do not need people who are ready to undermine or attack positive and effective policies of government.<br>
  Whilst all parties would love to have total control, it is important that there are other political parties and candidates in parliament that will help strengthen and support the governing party with any critical policies to protect the state whilst also keeping them in line or in check for any measure that could abuse their power.<br>
  I have researched every candidate and have provided references to their policies and statements.<br>
  This election, your vote WILL NOT be counted if you do not number every single candidate.<br>
  The list of candidates are available below:<br>

            This party has made excellent use of evidence based scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
            They have developed the policies to kick-start manufacturing in Australia, to improve the quality and profitability of local farms, to take a preventative approach to tackle the rising cost of Hospitals and Health Care Cover, to improve the quality of Education that will ensure people can access the necessary skills and qualifications for the workforce.<br>
            They have warned the government about the growing number of redundant workers in Australia and pushed the government to pass their policies to transition redundant workers to work at the renewable energy industry, the recycling industries, battery storage and technology industries etc.<br>
            <a href="https://greens.org.au/wa/person/cameron-pidgeon">Cameron Pidgeon</a> in particular will push for Affordable Housing, sustainable urban development and increased job opportunities.

        Labor will support a strong and competitive advanced manufacturing sector.
        <br>Labor will reinvigorate Australia's renewable energy industry, encourage energy efficiency and invest in low carbon energy solutions<br>
        Labor will grow the renewable energy sector beyond 2020 through policies to deliver at least 50% of our electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030<br>
        It will be a huge cost to the future if we don't act on Climate Change. Labor will generate the revenue by implementing policies similiar to Germany and the Netherlands where there is no negative gearing and no franking credit refunds on dividends.<br>
        <a href="https://www.alp.org.au/our-people/our-people/rob-meecham/">Rob Meecham</a> himself is concerned about climate change and the devastation it promises to unleash on the world if emissions of greenhouse gases are not curtailed. He firmly believes the warming of the earth will not stop until we reduce the concentration of the gases in the atmosphere.

          This is a divided dysfunctional political party.<br>
          In order to ensure everyone votes along party lines, bullying and harassment is coerced.<br>
          A number of women left the party because of bullying.<br>
          This party runs a part time parliament because they don't even show up for the full 5 days per week.<br>
          They want to spend $200 Billion over the next 10 years for Defence:<br>

        This is a political party that wants to make sure Western Australia will have 100% per person of the national GST pool.<br>
