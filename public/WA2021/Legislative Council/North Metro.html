<h2>Western Australia Senate Canditates for 2021 State Election</h2>
<p>
    Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Western Australia.<br>
    During this turbulant year where the world is facing a severe pandemic, it is important to have a strong, sustainable and accountable government.<br>
    It is very important to have all voices heard and find ways of making the state better and more effective in handling any challenges that comes our way.<br>
    Whilst it is important to have a strong and stable government, all political parties are using group ticket votes to further their own interests rather than choosing what is best for the state.<br>
    YOU MUST NOT VOTE ABOVE THE LINE. By voting above the line, it is possible you could be picking a party that wants to undermine coronavirus restrictions or allow everyone to hold a gun which could result in horrible mass shootings in WA.<br>
    You need to know who your last preference candidate is going to be as well as your first.<br>
    By not voting for the most dangerous and chaotic candidate last, you are increasing the chance of that chaotic candidate too be voted in.<br>
    Western Australia is lucky to have a fantastic government currently in place but it does need improvement, diversity and accountability.<br>
    Western Australia needs to have political parties in parliament that are strong and stable and won't use and abuse their power.<br>
    To keep a government strong, they need to know there is potentially other effective people surrounding them that have high expectations and expect the best for WA.<br>
    They do not need people who are ready to undermine or attack positive and effective policies of government.<br>
    Whilst all parties would love to have total control, it is important that there are other political parties and candidates in parliament that will help strengthen and support the governing party with any critical policies to protect the state whilst also keeping them in line or in check for any measure that could abuse their power.<br>
    I have researched every candidate and have provided references to their policies and statements.<br>
    The top political parties and candidates are people who I believe will support, strengthen and provide positive outcomes for government.<br>
    The first party I have chosen may not be the governing party but they are highly supportive of the critical policies that the government has made and they want to go even further to make better and positive changes for the state.<br>
    The last party I have chosen is very devisive and destructive. They are a far right wing party who doesn't believe in the coronavirus, vaccination, strong gun protection and climate change.<br>
    This election, your vote WILL NOT be counted if you do not number every single candidate below the line.<br>
    The list of candidates are available below:<br>

            This party has made excellent use of evidence based scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>

            This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>
            They are active, hard working and very efficient in parliament house.<br>
            They have developed the policies to kick-start manufacturing in Western Australia, to improve the quality and profitability of local farms, to take a preventative approach to tackle the rising cost of Hospitals and Health Care Cover, to improve the quality of Education that will ensure people can access the necessary skills and qualifications for the workforce.<br>

                    We deserve policy that is rigorous and robust;

            This party has a detailed a significant plan for Western Australia just like the Greens above. <br> 
            They have made WA safe, strong and secure. They could have well reached the very top of my list if it hadn't been for the following:<br>
            - They named a group of people 'anarchists'. They could have worked and co-operated with groups such as Extinction Rebellion who were trying to help the homeless people of WA.<br>
            - They could have better planned and co-ordinated the relocation of homeless people from the tents in Fremantle to places like fruit farms who need workers.<br>

            where he is using his right as the owner of the facebook platform to regulate usage, they should better support and collaborate with the community to use preferred platforms.<br>
            - They responded negatively straight away to a Renewable Energy plan by Zak Kirkup rather than properly assessing feasibility of the plan.<br>
            Labor will support a strong and competitive advanced manufacturing sector.<br>
            WA Labor will actively encourage companies to establish operations in Western Australia and provide reasonable incentives to attract new industries that will provide economic benefits to the state by producing goods or services for export, replace imports, create jobs and facilitate the transfer of valuable skills.<br>

            Hence we must be careful to utilise them in such a way that there will be reserves left for future generations, and to protect the environment from long term damage through erosion, pollution and other impacts.
            Energy is going through a worldwide transition, from finite fossil fuel sources to renewable sources. Western Australia has to make this transition in a phased and responsible way, to maintain energy security, jobs and the economy.<br>
            We must promote renewable energy services in Western Australia to provide lower-cost, more reliable and sustainable energy services to West Australian households. <br>
            This should be done over a number of years so to protect our state from blackouts.

            Not having policies to protect the state from the coronavirus is one dangerous aspect but also risking the lives of Western Australians through legalisation of guns is absolutely irresponsible.<br>
