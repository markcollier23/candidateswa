<h2>Western Australia Senate Canditates for 2022 Federal Election</h2>
<p>
    Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Australia.<br>
    It is important to select each individual candidate that would deliver the best policies for the country.<br>
    I have researched every candidate and documented their party policies below.<br>
    When I decide on the order of my vote, I'm not just voting for a leader or a candidate but I am voting for the political party as a whole.<br>
    After fully researching each party policy I would then take into consideration the quality of the candidate and the quality of the leader.<br>
    The reason for this is that the candidate who is elected will have some degree of influence over the leader and vice versa.<br>
    I have outlined a summary for each candidate/political party below.<br> 
    Each of the statements and claims made here have supporting documentation and references. See Lengend for more details.<br>
    Legend:<br>
    - [BIO]: This contains information and research specifically about the candidate (Reference to the source of info is provided).<br>
    - [REF]: This contains information and research specifically about the political party (Reference to the source of info is provided).<br>
    - [BILLS]: These contain the bills that elected political parties have voted for in the past.<br>
    I have made the verdict that the Senate Candidates should be numbered as so:

            This party has made excellent use of evidence based scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
            They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
            This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>
            They are active, hard working and very efficient in parliament house.<br>
            Nearly half of the bills I randomly look through in parliament have been developed by Green party members.<br>
            They have developed the policies to kick-start manufacturing in Australia, to improve the quality and profitability of local farms, to take a preventative approach to tackle the rising cost of Hospitals and Health Care Cover, to improve the quality of Education that will ensure people can access the necessary skills and qualifications for the workforce.<br>
            They have pushed the government to pass their policies to transition redundant workers to work at the renewable energy industry, the recycling industries, battery storage and technology industries etc.<br>

            This political party is an anti-vaccination and anti-fluoride party.<br>
            Vaccination is very important to stop the spread of disease.<br>
            People need to vaccinate not just for the benefit of themselves but for others too.<br>
            This political party would put Australia's health at risk and again, it's not worth the risk!

            This is a far right wing Trump style anti-immigration party.<br>
            They want to remove Australia from the United Nations Refugee Convention and intensify the abuse of refugees in detention centres. <br>
            They want to allow discrimination on the grounds of race and religion in order to support a Trump like ban on certain countries with a high percentage of Muslims.<br>
            One Nation believes Multiculturalism has failed everywhere. They believe it is negative and divisive "a weight that is drowning our once safe and cohesive society"<br>
            The humanitarian disaster that this political party will cause for asylum seekers would be much worse than the Liberal party.<br>
            Not only this, One Nation would also support the vaccination policies of Clive Palmer's United Australia party.

            This party wants to remove all coronavirus restrictions, having the same dangerous ideas as Clive Palmer.<br>
            The worst thing about this party is that they would like to legalise guns for everyone.<br>
            If criminals are allowed to get their hands on these guns, Australia would be a bloodbath.<br>
            These gun policies are more extreme than One Nation. 
            They want to abolish all government services and entities for Education, Health and Energy.<br>
            They want to withdraw from all climate policies.<br>
            They will cause thousands of job losses for those who work in the Government sector because government services will no longer be funded under this party.<br>

            This party is highly dangerous and extreme. The risk of a full-scale war occuring within Australia will be highly likely under this party.<br>

            Their stance against multi-culturalism will be the trigger for ethnic divisions and large scale violence.<br>
