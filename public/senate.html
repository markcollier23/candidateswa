<h2>Western Australia Senate Canditates for 2019 Federal Election</h2>
<p>
    Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Australia.<br>
    It is important to select each individual candidate that would deliver the best policies for the country.<br>
    I have researched every candidate, printed their policies out on at least 1 or 2 pages per political party and
    highlighted the positives and negatives of each policy.<br>
    Although you are allowed to number the candidates from 1 to 12 (or 1 to 6 if you are voting above the line)<br>
    -  This will increase the chance of your least favourite candidate being elected!!<br>
    I have made the verdict that the Senate Candidates should be numbered as so:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="caret">Greens</span>
        <ul class="nested">
            This party has made excellent use of evidence based scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
            They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
            This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>
            They are active, hard working and very efficient in parliament house.<br>
            Nearly half of the bills I randomly look through in parliament have been developed by Green party members.<br>
            They have developed the policies to kick-start manufacturing in Australia, to improve the quality and profitability of local farms, to take a preventative approach to tackle the rising cost of Hospitals and Health Care Cover, to improve the quality of Education that will ensure people can access the necessary skills and qualifications for the workforce.<br>
            They have warned the Government about the job losses and the growing number of redundant workers from the car industry, the mining industry and the coal,oil and gas industries of Australia and that they should take action as soon as possible to transition the workers into better industries.<br>
            They have pushed the government to pass their policies to transition redundant workers to work at the renewable energy industry, the recycling industries, battery storage and technology industries etc.<br>

                Not only has this start-up taught her how to run and financially operate a small business, It allowed her to get a new appreciation of the issues and challenges that many people face across the community.<br>
