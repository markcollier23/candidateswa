<h1>Candidates for Tangney in the 2019 Federal Election</h1>
<p>
    Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Australia.<br>
    It is important to select each individual candidate that would deliver the best policies for the country.<br>
    I have researched every candidate, printed their policies out on at least 1 or 2 pages per political party and
    highlighted the positives and negatives of each policy.<br>
    Supporting documents are available for each political party:<br>
    - [REF]: References included here are underlined in a hyperlink. This contains more information about the party.<br>
    - [PIC]: This contains Green and Red/Pink Highlighting. Policies highlighted in Green are policies that I like. Policies in red or pink are the policies that I don't like.<br>
    - [BILLS]: These contain the bills that elected political parties have voted for in the past.<br>
    I have made the verdict that the Tangney Candidates should be numbered as so:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="caret">1: Martin Spencer (Greens)</span>

            [<a href="https://candidateswa.herokuapp.com/legislation/Green.html" target="_blank">BILLS</a>]<br>
            This party has made excellent use of evidence based scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
            They have developed the policies to kick-start manufacturing in Australia, to improve the quality and profitability of local farms, to take a preventative approach to tackle the rising cost of Hospitals and Health Care Cover, to improve the quality of Education that will ensure people can access the necessary skills and qualifications for the workforce.<br>
            They have warned the government about the growing number of redundant workers in Australia and pushed the government to pass their policies to transition redundant workers to work at the renewable energy industry, the recycling industries, battery storage and technology industries etc.<br>
            <a href="https://greens.org.au/wa/person/martin-spencer">Martin Spencer</a> is interested in investing for better connected and affordable public transport.

        <ul class="nested">
            [<a href="http://www.jillianhorton.com.au/" target="_blank">REF</a>]
            <br>Dr Jillian Horton wants to bring more urgent action on climate change and reducing the use and processing of plastics.
            <br>Dr Jillian Horton wants to bring innovative ways to turn the huge profits from large businesses and corporations translated into job and wage growth.
            <br>Dr Jillian Horton will stop the biggest coal mine in the Southern Hemisphere in the Galilee Basin from being built.<br>
        </ul>

            Labor will support a strong and competitive advanced manufacturing sector.
            <br>Labor will reinvigorate Australia's renewable energy industry, encourage energy efficiency and invest in low carbon energy solutions<br>
            Labor will grow the renewable energy sector beyond 2020 through policies to deliver at least 50% of our electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030<br>
            It will be a huge cost to the future if we don't act on Climate Change. Labor will generate the revenue by implementing policies similiar to Germany and the Netherlands where there is no negative gearing and no franking credit refunds on dividends.<br>
            <a href="https://www.alp.org.au/our-people/our-people/marion-boswell/">Marion Boswell</a> is concerned that Tangney receives little government expenditure or help compared to other electorates

            This is a political party that wants to make sure Western Australia will have 100% per person of the national GST pool.<br>
            They will act in the best interests of WA however I would prefer if they announce more details about their policies.<br>
            <a href="https://westernaustraliaparty.org.au/our-candidates">Gavin Waugh</a> has been raised locally and has the inside in local issues.

            This party has well researched policies over Immigration and Small Business and they look pretty good.<br>
            Unfortunately this party does not believe in Climate Change and they believe that Renewable Energy is one of the worst sources of power.<br>
            <a href="https://australianchristians.com.au/federal-elections-2019/">Mark Staer</a> has been involved in various community groups.

            The party have been spaming people in order to get their votes.<br>
            They are interested and keen to find out what Australians are thinking but they just need to put in more time and effort in parliament to follow this through.<br>
            <a href="https://www.unitedaustraliaparty.org.au/candidates/chris-fernandez/">Chris Fernandez</a> wants tax cuts now.

            This is a divided dysfunctional political party.<br>
            In order to ensure everyone votes along party lines, bullying and harassment is coerced.<br>
            A number of women left the party because of bullying.<br>
            This party runs a part time parliament because they don't even show up for the full 5 days per week.<br>
            They want to spend $200 Billion over the next 10 years for Defence:<br>

            Although this party hasn't committed responsibility or intention of doing this, they need rectify and explain how they would prevent these atrocities in the future.<br>

        He will make sure your salary, holidays and sick leave are all managed in a government account.<br>

            This is a far right wing Trump style anti-immigration party.<br>
            They want to remove Australia from the United Nations Refugee Convention and intensify the abuse of refugees in detention centres. <br>
            They want to allow discrimination on the grounds of race and religion in order to support a Trump like ban on certain countries with a high percentage of Muslims.<br>
            Under this party it will be very likely that asylum seekers and refugees will be killed "mysteriously"<br>
