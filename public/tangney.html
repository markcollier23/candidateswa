<h1>Candidates for Curtin in the 2019 Federal Election</h1>
<p>
    Your choice for this election is a choice that will shape the future for Australia.<br>
    It is important to select each individual candidate that would deliver the best policies for the country.<br>
    I have researched every candidate, printed their policies out on at least 1 or 2 pages per political party and
    highlighted the positives and negatives of each policy.<br>

            This party has made excellent use of evidence based scientific research to develop it's policies.<br>
            They have constructed a well thought out plan to transition towards Green Energy future.<br>
            This party is aware and active of all the surrounding issues that are involved in pushing ahead through it's plans.<br>
            They are active, hard working and very efficient in parliament house.<br>
            Nearly half of the bills I randomly look through in parliament have been developed by Green party members.<br>
            They have developed the policies to kick-start manufacturing in Australia, to improve the quality and profitability of local farms, to take a preventative approach to tackle the rising cost of Hospitals and Health Care Cover, to improve the quality of Education that will ensure people can access the necessary skills and qualifications for the workforce.<br>
            They have warned the Government about the job losses and the growing number of redundant workers from the car industry, the mining industry and the coal,oil and gas industries of Australia and that they should take action as soon as possible to transition the workers into better industries.<br>
            They have pushed the government to pass their policies to transition redundant workers to work at the renewable energy industry, the recycling industries, battery storage and technology industries etc.<br>
            <a href="https://greens.org.au/wa/person/cameron-pidgeon">Cameron Pidgeon</a> in particular will push for Affordable Housing, sustainable urban development and increased job opportunities.

            We need a clear national plan and action must be taken now to transition our economy to a sustainable future.<br>
            I will be increasing investment in renewable energy and battery technology. WA is in a unique position to maximise the clean energy opportunities and ensure a sustainable economy for our future.<br>
            I will be campaigning for more competition and transparency in the private health insurance industry.<br>
            I will be Stopping Labors proposed cuts to negative gearing and franking credits.<br>
            I will be working with Federal and State Governments to scrap payroll tax. This is a tax on jobs and a disincentive for business owners to grow and employ more people. Payroll tax has no place in a modern, flexible, global economy.<br>
            A more comprehensive plan of how to deal with an ageing population and the pressure this will put on our health services<br>
            We are experiencing some cruel government policy towards asylum seekers at the moment, and nobody wants to see that, but at the same time we need to make sure that we keep Australia's borders secure.<br>
            I'm socially progressive, but I'm not like Kerryn Phelps. Around that area Kerryn and my views are very departed. I don't think anyone wants to see kids in detention camps or sick people, but in terms of effectiveness of that bill. I'm not sure that was the right avenue to take.<br>

        Labor will support a strong and competitive advanced manufacturing sector. Manufacturing is vital to the Australian economy: manufacturers employ nearly a million Australians in high quality jobs, contribute more than six per cent of Gross Domestic Product and undertake a third of all business research and development.<br>
        Labor will implement an Advanced Manufacturing Future Fund which will help innovative Australian manufacturing firms to modernise and move into high-value production, making them globally competitive. The Fund will address the finance gap for small and medium enterprises, by partnering with private finance to reduce the perceived risk in innovative projects, making them more attractive to lenders of private capital and the appointment of an Australian Industry Advocate to facilitate these processes.
        Labor will reinvigorate Australia's renewable energy industry, encourage energy efficiency and invest in low carbon energy solutions<br>
        Labor will grow the renewable energy sector beyond 2020 through policies to deliver at least 50% of our electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030<br>
        It will be a huge cost to the future if we don't act on Climate Change. Labor will generate the revenue by implementing policies similiar to Germany and the Netherlands where there is no negative gearing and no franking credit refunds on dividends.<br>
        <a href="https://www.alp.org.au/our-people/our-people/rob-meecham/">Rob Meecham</a> himself is concerned about climate change and the devastation it promises to unleash on the world if emissions of greenhouse gases are not curtailed. He firmly believes the warming of the earth will not stop until we reduce the concentration of the gases in the atmosphere.
